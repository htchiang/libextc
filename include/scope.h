/**
 * Creates a new scope that performs automatic cleanup when exited. Works like
 * a statement, in that it takes a block of code that becomes the scope.
 *
 * Some notes for usage:
 *		- Variables that will be used in cleanup blocks must be declared OUTSIDE
 *		  of the scope. They will retain their assigned values.
 *		- Scopes must never contain declarations for variable-length arrays
 *		  because of the underlying 'goto' and 'switch' mechanics.
 *		- Only one 'scope_new' can appear in any given function. This
 *		  restriction may be removed in future versions.
 *		- It is illegal to 'return' or 'goto' out of a scope. 'sreturn' provides
 *		  the functionality of the former.
